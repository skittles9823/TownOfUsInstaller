# Town of Us - R Installer

## Usage

To use, either download and run the exe from [releases](https://github.com/skittles9823/TownOfUsInstaller/releases/latest), or run `python mogus.py`

The only needed user input is the game path.

## Note
I've since found that I've essentially rewritten an existing installer, check out [Modinstaller](https://github.com/whichtwix/Modinstaller) by Twix

After reading their code I've updated my own to get ahead of possible issues
